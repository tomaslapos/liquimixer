## Technical Architecture Notes (for AI/Developers)

### Payment System
- **Payment Gateway**: GP WebPay (Czech payment processor)

- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS

### Edge Functions
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| gpwebpay | Payment processing, callback handling, signature verification |
| subscription | Subscription CRUD, status check, pricing |
| invoice | Invoice generation, PDF creation, email delivery |

| geolocation | User location detection for pricing |
| contact | Contact form handling |
| billing | Billing data management |
| refund | Refund processing |
| reminder-notify | Subscription reminder emails |
| user-cleanup | Inactive user cleanup |

### Key Secrets Required (Supabase)
- `GPWEBPAY_MERCHANT_NUMBER` - GP WebPay merchant ID
- `GPWEBPAY_PRIVATE_KEY` - Base64 encoded RSA private key (PKCS#8)
- `GPWEBPAY_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` - Key password
- `GPWEBPAY_PUBLIC_KEY` - GPE public key for signature verification
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` - Email configuration
- `IDOKLAD_CLIENT_ID`, `IDOKLAD_CLIENT_SECRET` - iDoklad API credentials
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk backend key

### Database Tables
- `users` - User profiles synced with Clerk

- `pricing` - Locale-specific pricing (CZK, EUR, USD)
- `recipes`, `products`, `favorites` - User data

### Payment Flow (Version D)
1. User sees pricing modal (guest state)
2. User accepts terms, clicks "Register and Pay"
3. Clerk registration modal opens
4. After successful registration, subscription modal shows (logged-in state)
5. User clicks "Pay" - Supabase creates subscription + payment records
6. User redirected to GP WebPay gateway
7. After payment, callback updates payment status
8. Invoice generated and emailed to user
9. User redirected back with success/failure notification

### Known Issues & Solutions
- GP WebPay requires pure numeric ORDERNUMBER (max 15 digits)
- Signature uses RSA-SHA1 with pipe-delimited data string
- Edge Functions need `--no-verify-jwt` for payment callbacks
- Invoice columns: vat_rate, subtotal, vat_amount must exist in DB
