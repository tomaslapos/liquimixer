    "subtitle": "E-LIQUID CALCULATOR",
    "warning_title": "Focus on following safety guidelines when mixing",
    "warning_text": "When mixing e-liquid, always wear protective gloves and work in a well-ventilated area, especially when using nicotine boosters. Use only quality ingredients without additives and with food-grade certification suitable for vaping from verified suppliers. Follow exact ingredient ratios. Store finished liquid out of reach of children and pets.",
    "prep_title": "Prepare before mixing:",
    "prep_pg": "Propylene Glycol (PG)",
    "prep_pg_detail": "Propylene glycol is a colorless, odorless liquid that forms the base of e-liquids. It provides flavor transfer and creates the characteristic \"throat hit\" sensation. It is hygroscopic, so store it in a closed container. PG is generally considered safe for inhalation and is also used in food and pharmaceuticals.",
    "prep_vg": "Vegetable Glycerin (VG)",
    "prep_vg_detail": "Vegetable glycerin is a thick, sweet liquid derived from vegetable oils. It is responsible for producing thick vapor and adds a gentle sweetness to the liquid. The higher the VG ratio, the thicker the vapor, but less pronounced flavor. VG is suitable for direct lung (DL) vaping and high-power devices.",
    "prep_flavors": "Optional Flavors",
    "prep_flavors_detail": "E-liquid flavors are concentrated aromas specifically designed for vaping. Use only flavors intended for e-liquids, not food flavorings! Concentration typically ranges between 5-20% depending on the flavor type. Fruit flavors are more intense, while dessert and tobacco flavors require higher percentages and longer steeping.",
    "prep_nicotine": "Nicotine Booster or Salt",
    "prep_nicotine_detail": "<strong>Nicotine Booster:</strong> Traditional form of nicotine with a more pronounced throat hit. Suitable for regular vaping.<br><br><strong>Nicotine Salt:</strong> A gentler form of nicotine that absorbs faster and has a weaker throat hit even at higher concentrations. Suitable for pod systems and MTL devices. WARNING: Nicotine is a poison! Always wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area.",
    "prep_gloves": "Medical Gloves",
    "prep_gloves_detail": "Nitrile or latex gloves are essential when working with nicotine. Nicotine is easily absorbed through the skin and can cause poisoning. Gloves also protect against contamination of the mixture and maintain sterility. Use disposable gloves and dispose of them safely after work. If skin is splashed with nicotine, wash thoroughly with soap and water.",
    "prep_bottle": "Empty Glass Bottle",
    "prep_bottle_detail": "Glass bottles are ideal for storing e-liquids as they don't react with the contents and don't affect taste. Dark glass (amber) protects from UV radiation and extends shelf life. Bottles with droppers or narrow necks are suitable for mixing. Always thoroughly clean and dry bottles before use.",
    "prep_dropper": "Dropper, Pipette or Syringe",
    "prep_dropper_detail": "Measuring tools are essential for precise dosing of ingredients. <strong>Dropper:</strong> Suitable for smaller volumes, less precise. <strong>Pipette:</strong> More accurate than dropper, suitable for medium volumes. <strong>Syringe (without needle):</strong> Most accurate option, ideal for nicotine. Use separate tools for each ingredient to avoid contamination.",
    "prep_measuring": "Measuring Tools",
    "prep_measuring_detail": "For accurate mixing, you need reliable measuring tools. <strong>Graduated cylinders:</strong> For measuring volume in ml. <strong>Measuring syringes:</strong> Various sizes for different ingredients (1ml for nicotine, 5-10ml for VG/PG). Always measure twice and mix once!",
    "app_description": "Calculator for safe e-liquid mixing with precise PG/VG ratio, flavor, and nicotine calculations. Don't start from scratch every time — save your favorite recipes and products or share them with friends. Also works as an offline app in 31 languages.",
    "disclaimer_title": "Disclaimer",
    "disclaimer_text": "By clicking the \"Start Mixing\" button, the user confirms being at least 18 years of age. The user acknowledges that LiquiMixer serves solely as a calculation tool (calculator) and assumes no responsibility for the final product. The user bears full responsibility for proper mixing, handling of ingredients, and compliance with safety procedures.",
